    "description": "C programming language is a machine-independent programming language that is mainly used to create many types of applications and operating systems such as Windows, and other complicated programs such as the Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and games and is considered a programming foundation in the process of learning any other programming language. Operating systems and diverse application software for computer architectures ranging from supercomputers to PLCs and embedded systems are examples of such applications.",

    "description": "Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Java is a general purpose programming language, much like Python or JavaScript. The language itself is specifically an object oriented programming language, so bears similarities to C++, C#. Java is also a platform, which means that Java code can run on any machine that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) on it.",

JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at — displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. It is the third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, two of which (HTML and CSS) we have covered in much more detail in other parts of the Learning Area.",

    "description": "Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of different programs and isn't specialized for any specific problems. Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.",
